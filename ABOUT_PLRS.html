    <h1>About the Public Legal Record System (PLRS)</h1>

    <div class="box">
      The Public Legal Record System (PLRS) is an open, cryptographically verifiable
      record system designed to eliminate silent edits, hidden revisions, and
      discretionary report control in legal and protective processes.
    </div>

    <h2>Why PLRS Exists</h2>
    <div class="box">
      In many modern systems, critical legal records can be:
      <ul>
        <li>Edited after the fact</li>
        <li>Rewritten without visible trace</li>
        <li>Reinterpreted across time</li>
        <li>Restricted behind closed institutional access</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      PLRS was created to solve one specific problem:
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Once a record is created, it should never be able to disappear or silently change.</strong>
    </div>

    <h2>What Makes PLRS Different</h2>
    <div class="box">
      Unlike traditional databases or case management systems, PLRS:
      <ul>
        <li>Uses cryptographic hashes to lock records permanently</li>
        <li>Operates on append-only public indices</li>
        <li>Allows challenges without overwriting original records</li>
        <li>Separates identity from public truth through anonymization</li>
        <li>Allows anyone to independently verify integrity</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>What PLRS Is Not</h2>
    <div class="box warn">
      PLRS does not:
      <ul>
        <li>Decide guilt or innocence</li>
        <li>Replace judges, attorneys, or courts</li>
        <li>Make moral or legal rulings</li>
        <li>Expose identities without consent</li>
      </ul>
      It exists only to preserve the integrity of records.
    </div>

    <h2>Who Can Use PLRS</h2>
    <div class="box">
      PLRS can be used by:
      <ul>
        <li>Private citizens</li>
        <li>Journalists</li>
        <li>Attorneys and legal teams</li>
        <li>Advocacy organizations</li>
        <li>Courts and oversight bodies</li>
      </ul>
      No permission, account, or institutional affiliation is required to verify records.
    </div>

    <h2>Verification Over Trust</h2>
    <div class="box">
      PLRS is built on a single principle:
      <br /><br />
      <strong>You should never be required to trust a platform, authority, or institution to know whether a record was altered.</strong>
      <br /><br />
      If the hashes match, the record is authentic.  
      If they do not, the tampering is provable.
    </div>

    <h2>Public Accountability</h2>
    <div class="box">
      By making records publicly verifiable rather than privately controlled,
      PLRS shifts accountability away from discretionary power and toward
      mathematical proof.
