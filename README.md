# LegalRecord

**LegalRecord is an open-source system for creating tamper-resistant, structured legal timelines.**  
It helps individuals document court orders, official actions, and real-world events in a standardized, verifiable format.

The project is designed for **accuracy, auditability, and privacy**—not advocacy or enforcement.

---

## Core Features

- **Append-only event logging** (no silent edits)
- **Automatic timestamps**
- **Court order vs. reality comparison**
- **Tokenized public data** (e.g., `Child_1`, `Event_3`, `Location_5`)
- **Private identity mapping (user-owned)**
- **Court-ready report generation (PDF/CSV)**
- **Open algorithms and transparent logic**

---

## Design Principles

- **Transparency:** All system logic is public and auditable.
- **Privacy:** Real identities remain private and encrypted.
- **Immutability:** Records are versioned, not overwritten.
- **Neutrality:** LegalRecord does not take positions on cases.
- **Portability:** Users fully own and export their data.

## What LegalRecord Is

- A personal legal documentation system  
- A structured timeline generator for court cases  
- A compliance tracker for legal orders  
- A report engine for attorneys and appeals  
- A source of anonymized public pattern data  

---

## What LegalRecord Is Not

- Not a law firm  
- Not legal advice

LegalRecord provides **records**, not **judgments**.

- Evidence files

### Public Layer (Tokenized, Shareable)

- Used for reports, audits, and statistical analysis
- No personal identities are exposed

---

## Use Cases

- Family court & custody documentation
- Visitation and compliance tracking
- Court order verification
- Attorney preparation and appeals
- Civil rights documentation
- Institutional pattern analysis
