# Contributing to the Public Legal Record System (PLRS)
**File:** CONTRIBUTING.md  
**Status:** Active Contribution Control  
**Purpose:** To define how external parties may participate in the PLRS project without compromising its legal, structural, or defensive integrity.

---

## 1. CORE CONTRIBUTION PRINCIPLE

PLRS is an **open system** but **not an open-authority system**.

This means:
- Anyone may review the standards
- Anyone may audit the logic
- Anyone may propose improvements
- No one may silently alter doctrine, validation, or immutability rules

Participation is welcome.  
Control of core principles is not transferable.

---

## 2. WHO MAY CONTRIBUTE

The following contributors are explicitly welcomed:

- Software developers
- Legal professionals
- Journalists
- Data auditors
- Digital security researchers
- Advocacy organizations
- Survivors and impacted families

Contributions may include:
- Code
- Documentation
- Security audits
- Jurisdictional compatibility overlays
- Tooling enhancements
- Educational materials

---

## 3. WHAT MAY BE CONTRIBUTED

✅ Allowed:
- New tools that consume or generate valid PLRS records  
- UX improvements that do NOT weaken validation  
- Independent verification utilities  
- Documentation translations  
- Jurisdiction-specific export formats (non-destructive)  
- Educational and onboarding material  

❌ Prohibited:
- Weakening of immutability
- Softening of public visibility defaults
- Introduction of discretionary overrides

Any pull request proposing a prohibited change will be rejected without appeal.

---

### 4.3 Jurisdiction Overlays (Non-Destructive Only)
Contributors may add:
- Export formats
- Court filing templates
- Affidavit structures

These must:
- Wrap PLRS records
- Never alter the core data
- Never reinterpret events

---

## 5. SUBMISSION PROCESS

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make changes with:
   - Clear commit messages
   - No force-push history rewriting
4. Submit a pull request with:
   - Purpose of the change
   - Affected files
   - Validation confirmation

---

## 6. REVIEW AND ACCEPTANCE RULES

All submissions are evaluated on:
- Structural safety
- Preservation of doctrine
- Compatibility with SPEC.md
- Non-violation of THREAT_MODEL.md
- Compliance with schema.json
- Compliance with TIME_NORMALIZATION.md

There is **no obligation** to accept any contribution.

---

## 7. SECURITY REPORTING

Security vulnerabilities must be reported via:

- Private disclosure to repository maintainers
- With full reproduction steps
- With proof-of-impact

Public zero-day disclosure without notice will be treated as a hostile action.

---

## 8. LEGAL SAFETY NOTICE

Contributors acknowledge:

- This system interacts with real legal harm
- False contributions can produce real-world damage
- Malicious participation may create criminal exposure
- All records generated using PLRS may be used in court

By contributing, you agree to act in good faith.

---

## 9. NO OWNERSHIP TRANSFER

Contribution does NOT grant:
- Ownership
- Doctrine authority
- Administrative privilege
- Governance control

PLRS remains structurally immune to capture.

---

## 10. CONTRIBUTION ETHOS

This project exists for:

- Truth without discretion
- Evidence without reinterpretation
- Protection without institutional silence
- Accountability without permission

If your contribution weakens those goals, it will not be merged.
